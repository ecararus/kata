In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y. \r\nFor example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 pence individually, but this week we have a special\r\noffer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30. \r\n\r\nIn fact this week’s prices are:\r\n\r\n|Item |Unit Price |Special Price|\r\n| --- |:---------:|:-----------:|\r\n| A   |   50      | 3 for 130   |\r\n| B   |   30      | 2 for 45    |\r\n| C   |   20      |             |\r\n| D   |   15      |             |\r\n\r\nOur checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll\r\nrecognise the two B’s and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95). \r\nBecause the pricing changes frequently, we need to be able to pass in a set of pricing rules each time we start\r\nhandling a checkout transaction.\r\n\r\n##Deployment \r\nPivotal cloud: \r\n```\r\ncf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io\r\ncf push \r\ncf logs kata\r\n```\r\ncheck http://kata.cfapps.io/swagger-ui.html\r\n\r\n## Convention:\r\n - Test names does not contains \"test\" prefix and should provide as message the purpose of test(will be easy to read in case it is failing).\r\n - Test should have coverage > 70%.\r\n - Unit test class will have \"Test\" postfix.\r\n - Integration test class will have \"IT\" postfix.\r\n\r\n## DISCLAIMER:\r\nPurpose of project is only educational.\r\nThis project should not be used for any commercial purpose.\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/.\r\n\r\n## Author:\r\nEugeniu Cararus\r\ncararuseugeniu@gmail.com\r\n",
